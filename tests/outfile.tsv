NO	YES	election AND UK AND conservatives	Nigel Farage has predicted that David Cameron will lead the biggest party after the election because he is connecting with middle-class Tories and looks like a leader, whereas Ed Miliband is not connecting with working class voters in the north.The Ukip leader cast Cameron in a more favourable light than he has done previously, suggesting he is flirting with the possibility of working with the prime minister in a Tory-led alliance in return for an EU referendum.In contrast, he mocked Miliband as someone who you could not imagine going into a working men’s club in the north and ordering a drink.Farage has spent the past few years being equally dismissive of all the main three mainstream political parties as part of a Westminster metropolitan elite, reserving particular scorn for Cameron as the man who once branded Ukip a bunch of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists.The Ukip leader may believe a political chance has opened up for him to hold Cameron’s feet to the fire on the issue of an EU referendum if the Tories fall short of a majority and Ukip wins a small number of seats.In an interview ahead of the Master Investor conference with the Isle of Man-based businessman Jim Mellon, Farage said: “I think right now the Conservatives will be the biggest party … The reason I think the Conservatives will be the biggest party is because whatever he does politically, Cameron actually looks like a Conservative leader.“For a lot of Conservative voters, they find that reassuring.
