Will Carly Fiorina decide to run for president?	Last week, presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina was anointed a “real feminist” by The Week, even though “she has no use for laws mandating ‘equal pay’ or paid maternity leave or contraceptive coverage.” In Jeb Bush’s Liberty University commencement speech over the weekend, the likely Republican presidential candidate told his audience that “wherever there is a child waiting to be born, we say choose life,” and in the same breath added, without irony, that he derided the “arrogance” of treating women and girls “as possessions without rights and dignity.”  And next month, the Independent Women’s Forum - a powerful conservative women’s group based in DC - is hosting a “Women Lead” summit to “move forward with a positive agenda for women.” The speakers include Christina Hoff Sommers (who has defended the misogynist horde known as GamerGate), Naomi Schaefer Riley (who wrote that a woman who was raped and murdered “should have known better” than to be at a bar alone), and Katie Pavlich (who says feminists oppose guns because “modern feminism can’t survive without victims” and the movement would rather see women raped than armed).	-1	0.403586123662	-1	0.476549449633	0.0		-0.0163043478261		0.0		0.0	Qsubbject=Fiorina, Sobject=feminist	0.475371038663	Qverb=decide   Sverb=anoint   	0.333333333333	Qverb=decide, Sverb=anoint	0.428571428571	Qdate=2015-05-04, Sdate=2015-05-13	0.082911454		0.0		0

Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?	Tens of thousands of activists from both sides of the Scottish independence referendum campaign will take to the streets on Thursday in the largest and most intensely coordinated get-out-the-vote operation the country has ever seen.A mixture of seasoned party activists and first-timers radicalised by the referendum campaign will be making phone calls, knocking on doors and ferrying voters to polling stations from 7am.Yes Scotland estimates that 35,000 activists coordinated by 300 local yes groups across the country will contact 1.5 million voters on the day, while Better Together has already made 50,000 calls in the past 48 hours and estimates upwards of 25,000 activists will mobilise on Thursday.In a strategy that has proved successful in UK target seats and US elections, Better Together is asking core no voters to fill in a pledge card with the time they intend to visit their polling station, in order to allow local activists to stagger resources effectively.The pro-union campaign has also been contacting 500,000 individuals it has identified as still undecided, by mail, phone and face to face in the runup to polling day.On the yes side, grassroots organisations such as Women for Independence and the Radical Independence Campaign will work alongside SNP activists under the Yes Scotland umbrella for the day, sending their members to local yes hubs from which they will be organised to contact voters identified by the YesMo mobile app, which canvassers have been using to log voting intention.The yes campaign in particular will concentrate on reaching those who don't normally vote and are newly registered.	-1	0.245410531216	0	0.682344918306	0.0		0.0583657587549		0.0	Qsubject=Scotland, Ssubject=thousands	0.0		0.554535605678	Qverb=choose   Sverb=take   	1.0	Qverb=choose, Sverb=take	0.0	Qdate=2015-12-22, Sdate=2014-09-17	0.078847654		0.0		0
