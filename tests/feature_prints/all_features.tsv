Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?	Its latest survey for the Sunday Times shows 35% could do so on 18 September, with Labour voters rebelling in larger numbers against a UK being run by the Tories and – it appears – their own party.Add on the 16% of Liberal Democrat voters and 7% of Tories who now prefer independence over a Britain run by their own parties, and YouGov appears to have established the truth of the yes campaign's assertion that independence is not a solely nationalist cause.Despite the surge in support for independence, the Scottish National party has had few electoral successes on a domestic front since its Holyrood landslide in May 2011: it has won only one of the 27 local council byelections since May 2012; it has won only one out of three Holyrood byelections, and that with a reduced majority; and its European vote in May fell very slightly, even as the Tory and Labour votes grew, and Ukip's doubled to win its first seat.And the new YouGov poll shows the SNP's vote for Holyrood averages out at 37% across both constituency and regional list votes with Labour not far behind – on domestic policy at least, averaging 32% across both constituency and list votes.Yet now 51% of voters in Scotland appear to be backing independence.	0	0.546535959687	-1	0.272420817256	0.0		0.0700934579439		0.0	Qsubject=Scotland, Ssubject=it	0.0	Qsubbject=Scotland, Sobject=one	0.340210984011	Qverb=choose   Sverb=win   	0.333333333333	Qverb=choose, Sverb=win	0.0	Qdate=2015-12-23, Sdate=2014-09-07	0.10330997		0.0		0		0.0	Qverb=choose, Sverb=win

"The former EU commissioner for monetary union said it would not be possible for an independent Scotland to join the EU if it used the pound without a formal currency deal or its own central bank.Olli Rehn, who stood down in July as the European commissioner for monetary union and the euro, wrote to Danny Alexander, the chief secretary of the Treasury, this week to say having a central bank was an essential requirement of EU membership.Now an MEP, Rehn said in a letter published on Tuesday night that Alex Salmond's apparent plan to use the pound without the formal permission of London – a policy known as ""sterlingisation"" – would ""simply not be possible"".The intervention came as the pound fell to a five-month low against the US dollar and also weakened against the euro, hours after a YouGov poll showed for the first time that the yes campaign needed only a three-point swing to win the independence referendum.With the vote due in just over two weeks, it showed support for independence at 47%.Rehn said the currency issue arose because ""that would obviously imply a situation where the candidate country concerned would not have a monetary authority of its own and thus no necessary instruments of the EMU"" [economic and monetary union].He wrote that a core part of any new membership negotiation was for the applicant to commit themselves to EMU, and that implied the ""will and expected capacity"" to meet the tests for joining the euro – a policy Salmond has repeatedly rejected.Senior figures in the no campaign conceded the poll had accurately picked up a surge in support for independence."	0	0.472126372493	-1	0.298100651846	0.0		0.0330882352941		0.0	Qsubject=Scotland, Ssubject=commissioner	0.0		0.43535532368	Qverb=choose   Sverb=say   	0.333333333333	Qverb=choose, Sverb=say	0.0	Qdate=2015-12-23, Sdate=2014-09-02	0.08089		0.0		0		0.0	Qverb=choose, Sverb=say

Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?	The people of Scotland are to be offered a historic opportunity to devise a federal future for their country before next year's general election, it emerged  on Saturday night, as a shock new poll gave the campaign for independence a narrow lead for the first time.Amid signs of panic and recrimination among unionist ranks about the prospects of a yes vote on 18 September, the Observer has learned that a devolution announcement designed to halt the nationalist bandwagon is due to be made within days by the anti-independence camp.The plan, in the event of a no vote, is that people from all parts of Scottish society – rather than just politicians – would be invited to take part in a Scottish conference or convention that would decide on further large-scale transfers of power from London to Holyrood.A poll by YouGov for the Sunday Times sent shockwaves through the political establishment north and south of the border as it showed the yes camp had 51% to 49% for no, excluding the don't knows.	0	0.428372727077	-1	0.311606222677	0.0		-0.0116279069767		0.0	Qsubject=Scotland, Ssubject=it	0.0		0.478958563985	Qverb=choose   Sverb=emerge   	0.333333333333	Qverb=choose, Sverb=emerge	0.0	Qdate=2015-12-23, Sdate=2014-09-07	0.08046029		0.0		0		0.0	Qverb=choose, Sverb=emerge
