As posed in 1977 by Tam Dalyell, former MP for the Scottish constituency, it demands to know why MPs from Scotland (and now Wales and Northern Ireland) should be able to vote on issues such as health and education that affect England when English MPs have no power to vote on social and other policies that are devolved to the parliament in Edinburgh (and now also the assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast).Because welfare issues are devolved, members of the Westminster parliament elected from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have no power to decide how these policies should affect their constituents; ironically, they can vote only on welfare issues as they affect constituencies in England.Scotland's vote against independence and promises of more devolved tax-raising powers have put the English question, as it is also called, firmly back on the political agenda.	0	0.557587130088	-1	0.373749841777	0.4		-0.0142857142857		0.0	Qsubject=Scotland, Ssubject=they	0.0		1.0	Qverb=vote   Sverb=vote   	1.0	Qverb=vote, Sverb=vote	0.0	Qdate=2015-12-23, Sdate=2014-09-19	0.061367985		0.0		0		1.0	Qverb=vote, Sverb=vote

Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?	Its latest survey for the Sunday Times shows 35% could do so on 18 September, with Labour voters rebelling in larger numbers against a UK being run by the Tories and – it appears – their own party.Add on the 16% of Liberal Democrat voters and 7% of Tories who now prefer independence over a Britain run by their own parties, and YouGov appears to have established the truth of the yes campaign's assertion that independence is not a solely nationalist cause.Despite the surge in support for independence, the Scottish National party has had few electoral successes on a domestic front since its Holyrood landslide in May 2011: it has won only one of the 27 local council byelections since May 2012; it has won only one out of three Holyrood byelections, and that with a reduced majority; and its European vote in May fell very slightly, even as the Tory and Labour votes grew, and Ukip's doubled to win its first seat.And the new YouGov poll shows the SNP's vote for Holyrood averages out at 37% across both constituency and regional list votes with Labour not far behind – on domestic policy at least, averaging 32% across both constituency and list votes.Yet now 51% of voters in Scotland appear to be backing independence.	0	0.58839459664	-1	0.24845852299	0.0		0.0700934579439		0.0	Qsubject=Scotland, Ssubject=it	0.0	Qsubbject=Scotland, Sobject=one	0.340210984011	Qverb=choose   Sverb=win   	0.333333333333	Qverb=choose, Sverb=win	0.0	Qdate=2015-12-23, Sdate=2014-09-07	0.10330997		0.0		0		0.0	Qverb=choose, Sverb=win
