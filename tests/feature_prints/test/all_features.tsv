The fact that people like Adams can fall upwards into cushy sinecures and media careers – and indeed the fact that known blunderers like Harris-Quinney can get a berth at an occasion where people are auditioning for the Republican party presidential nomination – tells us something about what philosopher William Connolly calls the right’s “resonance machine”.

Will Carly Fiorina decide to run for president?	Last week, presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina was anointed a “real feminist” by The Week, even though “she has no use for laws mandating ‘equal pay’ or paid maternity leave or contraceptive coverage.” In Jeb Bush’s Liberty University commencement speech over the weekend, the likely Republican presidential candidate told his audience that “wherever there is a child waiting to be born, we say choose life,” and in the same breath added, without irony, that he derided the “arrogance” of treating women and girls “as possessions without rights and dignity.”  And next month, the Independent Women’s Forum - a powerful conservative women’s group based in DC - is hosting a “Women Lead” summit to “move forward with a positive agenda for women.” The speakers include Christina Hoff Sommers (who has defended the misogynist horde known as GamerGate), Naomi Schaefer Riley (who wrote that a woman who was raped and murdered “should have known better” than to be at a bar alone), and Katie Pavlich (who says feminists oppose guns because “modern feminism can’t survive without victims” and the movement would rather see women raped than armed).
