Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"Its latest survey for the Sunday Times shows 35% could do so on 18 September, with Labour voters rebelling in larger numbers against a UK being run by the Tories and – it appears – their own party.Add on the 16% of Liberal Democrat voters and 7% of Tories who now prefer independence over a Britain run by their own parties, and YouGov appears to have established the truth of the yes campaign's assertion that independence is not a solely nationalist cause.Despite the surge in support for independence, the Scottish National party has had few electoral successes on a domestic front since its Holyrood landslide in May 2011: it has won only one of the 27 local council byelections since May 2012; it has won only one out of three Holyrood byelections, and that with a reduced majority; and its European vote in May fell very slightly, even as the Tory and Labour votes grew, and Ukip's doubled to win its first seat.And the new YouGov poll shows the SNP's vote for Holyrood averages out at 37% across both constituency and regional list votes with Labour not far behind – on domestic policy at least, averaging 32% across both constituency and list votes.Yet now 51% of voters in Scotland appear to be backing independence."

Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"Alex Salmond has invited Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling to join his ""Team Scotland"" group to negotiate the breakup of Great Britain if the yes side prevails in Thursday's independence referendum.As a series of new polls confirmed that the referendum remains on a knife-edge – with the no vote  narrowly ahead – the Scottish first minister outlined a three-point negotiating plan that would kick in on Friday after a yes vote.This includes drafting in a team of specialists to negotiate Scotland's secession from the UK, drawing in leaders of civic Scotland to feed into the negotiations, and ensuring that all political opinions are represented to ""bring the country together"".Salmond's remarks prompted Darling, the leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, to accuse the first minister of embarking on a ""premature victory lap"".Salmond, who said  he would declare victory even if he won by just one vote, suggested that another referendum could not be held in this political generation if voters rejected independence."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"

David Cameron has delivered a stark message to the people of Scotland that they would face a ""painful divorce"" from the rest of United Kingdom if they voted for independence in the referendum on Thursday.In an emotional speech on his final visit north of the border before polling day, the prime minister warned that a yes vote would end the UK ""for good, for ever"" and would deprive the Scottish people of a shared currency and pooled pension arrangements.In a seeming attempt to reach out to voters who might be tempted to support independence to free Scotland from the Tories, Cameron said that he would not be prime minister forever – but a break with the rest of the UK would be permanent.In remarks that were more diplomatic than his joke last week about the ""effing Tories"", the prime minister told a Conservative Friends of the Union audience in Aberdeen: ""If you don't like me – I won't be here forever."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"""Farage had earlier said that the English were being ignored in the Scottish independence debate and needed a constitutional settlement of their own.The Ukip leader also blamed the prime minister for risking the future of the UK by refusing to give people in Scotland the option on the ballot paper of greater devolution.If there is a yes vote, this would diminish the UK globally, he added.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Farage said change would be needed for the whole union in the event of a no vote to give the English a fairer deal."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"The United Kingdom faces the ""disastrous"" prospect of losing its Trident nuclear deterrent and its permanent seat on the United Nations security council if Scotland votes for independence, the former prime minister Sir John Major has warned.As the leaders of the UK's three main political parties arrived in Scotland to attempt stop a haemorrhage of votes for independence, Major said the UK would be a weaker global force after a yes vote.The former prime minister, who campaigned unsuccessfully against the creation of the Scottish parliament in the 1997 general election, also warned that a yes vote in Scotland would encourage moves towards independence in Wales."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"Adding to that the roughly 2,350 people from across the UK who said independence would not happen, some 3,750 people did not support the position that Scotland would become independent – pretty much exactly half the total sample."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"Here the incoherence of the SNP’s position across so many areas comes into focus: they insist Scots get a bad enough deal from Westminster to justify all the costs and uncertainties of independence, while insisting negotiations between Scotland and a more Conservative-dominated rump UK would somehow be on terms favourable to them."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"As another report from Rusi, Defence in an Independent Scotland, concluded:  Many military capabilities currently possessed by the UK are ones that an independent Scotland would have no desire, or need, to possess … Those who argue that independence will bring defence benefits to Scotland … want Scotland to have the right of refusal in future British military adventures."

Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"The overall male to female ratio for the six main parties in Scotland fell after the UK Independence party’s candidates list became clear after the close of nominations, leading to an increase in the overall number of male candidates from 224 to 226 compared to the Guardian’s first diversity survey in March."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"""After all these scare stories [about privatisation] they've known that these cuts are coming along, but we weren't going to be told about it until after the polls had closed,"" he told the Good Morning Scotland show.The papers were passed to the BBC by a senior NHS whistleblower, who said they had become frustrated by claims from the yes campaign that the greatest threat to the NHS came from the UK government.Darling was speaking after the leaders of the UK's three main political parties signed a pledge to give more powers to Scotland if it rejects independence."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"

An emotional David Cameron illustrated the high stakes at play in the Scottish independence referendum when he pleaded with voters not to use the poll to give the ""effing Tories"" a kick.In the first of a series of choreographed interventions by the leaders of the UK's three main political parties in Scotland, the prime minister appeared on the verge of tears as he pleaded with voters to appreciate the scale of the decision and spoke of how he would be heartbroken by a yes vote.But he coupled his impassioned defence of the UK with a tough warning that Scotland could run out of money after independence because London would refuse to form a currency union with Edinburgh.Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, mocked the interventions by the three party leaders by declaring that ""Team Scotland"" would triumph over ""Team Westminster"".But the prime minister's warnings were reinforced as Standard Life, one of the leading pillars of Scotland's finance industry, warned it would move pensions and investments out of Scotland to protect its UK customers after a yes vote."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"The pro-union camp will hope that warnings about the financial instability that would follow a yes vote may be cutting through.Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, reinforced this point when he described the day as Salmond's ""black Wednesday"" after the Scottish financial industry giant Standard Life warned it would move pensions and investments out of Scotland to protect its UK customers after a yes vote.Bob Dudley, the BP chief executive, urged Scotland to vote against independence next week, arguing that oil wealth would best be protected by remaining inside the UK.Clegg visited the Scottish Borders to promise an ""exciting chapter"" of decentralisation not just for Scotland but England and the rest of the UK after a no vote."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"

David Cameron has spelled out to the people of Scotland the stark costs of a ""painful divorce"" from the rest of the United Kingdom as a poll showed nearly two-thirds of voters in England and Wales objected to the idea of sharing the pound.In an emotional but at times hard-edged speech on his last visit to Scotland before Thursday's independence referendum, the prime minister warned that a yes vote would end the UK ""for good, for ever"" and would deprive the Scottish people of a shared currency and pooled pension arrangements."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish secretary, told Lib Dem delegates on Sunday that the vision was of “a Scotland that raises the majority of its own revenues, that can borrow, tax and spend to meet Scotland’s priorities, and have the freedom to innovate and reform as never before.” Senior Lib Dems said they believed full income tax devolution was an essential part of proposals now being investigated by a commission under Lord Smith of Kelvin, set up by the UK parties after they won the independence referendum on 18 September."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"3 Lottery funding Scotland’s secretary of sport, Shona Robison, has made it clear that in the event of independence she expects the appropriate share of UK Sport’s budget (around £37m over four-years) to be transferred to SportScotland and for the lottery to continue in the way it currently operates."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"Scotch whisky makers could lose out if Scotland votes yes in Thursday's referendum, according to the Dutch bank Rabobank.Whisky is Scotland's second-largest export behind oil and gas and is worth £4.3bn a year to the local economy, but sales could be hit if the country loses access to the EU's free trade area and to markets in the rest of the world where Brussels has forged trade deals.The Scottish National party has argued that independence would boost food and drink manufacturers by giving them tailor-made support to sell abroad, while they would also benefit from the pound and uninterrupted EU membership.But Rabobank estimates a newly independent Scotland could be shut out of the EU for at least two years after a formal split from the rest of the UK in March 2016."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"If our budget continues to be at the mercy of Westminster it’s going to be harder to protect the things that we want to protect  Alexander references recent forecasts by the office for budget responsibility on future UK and Scotland revenues, adding:   We won’t be getting away from austerity if we vote for independence - we will be voting for austerity plus."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"""A Scottish yes to independence poses far more questions – about the currency, the debt, the oil, the future – than it answers but my best guess is that a yes would trigger a 3-5% fall by sterling as an initial reaction,"" he said.The recent strength of the pound has dented British exports but ministers will be anxious about any currency movements that show a lack of confidence in the future of the currency.Alexander said Rehn's views were a fatal blow to repeated suggestions by Salmond that an independent Scotland could use the pound freely if the UK government refused to set up a formal sterling zone.Alexander said sterlingisation ""is not only a bonkers idea, which flies in the face of any reasonable notion of what independence means and which would impose costs and risks on people and businesses in Scotland, it is also incompatible with Scotland's smooth re-entry into the EU"".The spike in yes support in the YouGov poll published by the Times and the Sun came only a few days after Salmond scored a convincing victory in his final televised debate against Better Together campaign leader Alistair Darling on BBC last week.With yes campaigners buoyed by his assertive performance, YouGov found that 30% of Labour voters were now planning to vote yes, after a week of successful attacks on the UK government's record on the NHS launched by the Scottish government and the official pro-independence campaign Yes Scotland.No campaigners said they thought up to 25% of Labour voters were now backing independence as opinions on both sides hardened; they admitted that put Labour, which commanded more than 1m votes in the 2010 general election, under intense pressure to step up its own party campaign.One Labour source said the party would now focus far more heavily on Salmond's threat to renege on Scotland's share of UK debts if the sterling zone proposal was vetoed, and the threat of a £6bn spending deficit in 2016 identified by the Institute for Fiscal Studies."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,Much of the press – in Scotland and the wider UK – are also anti-independence.
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"""Scottish independence means huge black eye for whole political establishment, especially Cameron and Milliband [sic],"" he tweeted.With the yes campaign in buoyant mood, the no team aims to focus on a message that Scots can have the best of both worlds if they remain in the UK, with more powers, including over tax and their budget, but with the financial security of staying in the UK and EU.A senior European commission official  issued a new warning that an independent Scotland could have to wait five years before getting back into the EU."
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,The leader of the Scottish National party at Westminster has suggested that the people of Scotland could vote to leave the UK in a second independence referendum within five years if David Cameron fails to deliver on promises for greater devolution and imposes more austerity north of the border.
Will Scotland choose independence from the UK in Sept. 2014?,"Tens of thousands of activists from both sides of the Scottish independence referendum campaign will take to the streets on Thursday in the largest and most intensely coordinated get-out-the-vote operation the country has ever seen.A mixture of seasoned party activists and first-timers radicalised by the referendum campaign will be making phone calls, knocking on doors and ferrying voters to polling stations from 7am.Yes Scotland estimates that 35,000 activists coordinated by 300 local yes groups across the country will contact 1.5 million voters on the day, while Better Together has already made 50,000 calls in the past 48 hours and estimates upwards of 25,000 activists will mobilise on Thursday.In a strategy that has proved successful in UK target seats and US elections, Better Together is asking core no voters to fill in a pledge card with the time they intend to visit their polling station, in order to allow local activists to stagger resources effectively.The pro-union campaign has also been contacting 500,000 individuals it has identified as still undecided, by mail, phone and face to face in the runup to polling day.On the yes side, grassroots organisations such as Women for Independence and the Radical Independence Campaign will work alongside SNP activists under the Yes Scotland umbrella for the day, sending their members to local yes hubs from which they will be organised to contact voters identified by the YesMo mobile app, which canvassers have been using to log voting intention.The yes campaign in particular will concentrate on reaching those who don't normally vote and are newly registered."
